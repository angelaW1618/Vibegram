## <a name="deploy">Deploy Your React App</a>

The simplest way to deploy your React app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=react&utm_source=create-react-app&utm_campaign=create-react-app-readme), recommended by many developers for its ease of use.

For more detailed instructions on deploying React applications, you can refer to the [React deployment guidelines](https://reactjs.org/docs/deployment.html).

Additionally, if your app includes Next.js components, see the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for specific deployment strategies.
